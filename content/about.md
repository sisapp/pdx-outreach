PDX Outreach for Justice helps coordinate and support outreach efforts for community organizing work. We seek to support groups, coalitions and individuals with printing / tech resources, networking / communication tools, canvassing, phone banking, etc.

We are firmly committed to fighting racism, colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, patriarchy and all forms of oppression and are eager to work with folks who share this vision for revolutionary change within our local communities and across the globe.
